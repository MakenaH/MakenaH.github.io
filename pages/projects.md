 2023  
 The magic item app was done as an assignment for school to showcase an understanding of routine through creating a multi-screen application in Kotlin and Compose. The app's purpose is for a user to be able to input some information about a magic item, either from a Table Top Roleplaying Game's source books or one created by the user, and see it displayed in both a detailed list and a complete list of all magic items.
