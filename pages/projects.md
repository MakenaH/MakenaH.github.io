2023  
The magic item app was done as an assignment for school to showcase an understanding of routine through creating a multi-screen application in Kotlin and Compose. The app's purpose is for a user to be able to input some information about a magic item, either from a Table Top Roleplaying Game's source books or one created by the user, and see it displayed in both a detailed list and a complete list of all magic items.

2023  
The website, DutchTreat, was a class exercise involving understanding and creating a website using ASP.NET with MVC architecture. The website simulates a shop selling classic artwork on a variety of things, such as mugs and posters by reading in information from a JSON file then outputting it in a pleasing manner. The site also has a contact form with built in validation and sends an email to the inputted email address using SendGrid API.

2022 
Draw from the Deck is a simple C# console application that was made as a personal project. The purpose of the application is to simulate a character drawing a card from a customized Deck of Many Things from the table top roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. The app asks for a number of cards the user wishes to draw, then randomly selects some cards from it's internal list and presents them to the user, asking whether the card was already drawn (if the fictional deck does not have all it's cards because someone else drew) to assure the cards the character draws are all unique, and continues until the number of requested unique cards has been met.
