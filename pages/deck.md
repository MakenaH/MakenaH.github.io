# DeckGenerator

Deck Generator is a simple C# console application that allows the user to enter a number of cards they wish to draw from the Dunegons & Dragons Deck of Many Things.

When presented with a card they can enter whether or not it's already been drawn, in the case their character may be using the Deck with other people.
