# About  

## Programming  

Makena Howat has been programming for 3 years, and has the most experience with C#. They enjoy programming for a variety of reasons, as it is a great interception between their enjoyment of logic and puzzle solving and creativity.  

## Hobbies  

They enjoy using other mediums as outputs for their enjoyment of being creative and constantly learning new skills. Whether it be an application or sweater, they always enjoy learning new ways to create. 
### Crochet  
Makena has enjoyed using crochet as a way to get their creative ideas out or as something to do with their hands while waiting for something taking particularly long to build.

### Drawing  
Makena has enjoyed doodling and drawing their entire life as something to idly do to keep their mind occupied or to pass time. They enjoy both traditional pencil on paper drawing, along with recent digital drawing.
