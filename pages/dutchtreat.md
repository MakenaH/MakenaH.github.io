# DutchTreat

[DutchTreat Repository]

The website, DutchTreat, was a class exercise involving understanding and creating a website using ASP.NET with MVC architecture. The website simulates a shop selling classic artwork on a variety of things, such as mugs and posters by reading in information from a JSON file then outputting it in a pleasing manner. The site also has a contact form with built in validation and sends an email to the inputted email address using SendGrid API.
